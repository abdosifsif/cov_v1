To create an admin user, you can follow these steps:

Make sure you have already set up the authentication system using php artisan make:auth.

Open your terminal and navigate to the root directory of your Laravel project.

Run the following command to open the interactive Tinker shell:

bash
Copy code
php artisan tinker
In the Tinker shell, create a new admin user by executing the following code:

php
Copy code
$admin = new \App\Models\Admin;
$admin->name = 'Admin Name';
$admin->email = 'admin@example.com';
$admin->password = bcrypt('password');
$admin->save();
Replace 'Admin Name', 'admin@example.com', and 'password' with the actual name, email, and password for your admin user.

Exit the Tinker shell by typing exit.

Now you have manually created an admin user. You can use these credentials to log in to the admin panel.

Please note that you may need to adjust the code according to your specific setup, such as the namespace and location of your Admin model.
